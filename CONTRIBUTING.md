## Coding Standards

### Backend (Python)

- Follow PEP 8 style guide

- Use TypeScript interfaces for props and state
- Format code with Prettier
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Make sure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- For backend, use pytest
- For frontend, use Jest and React Testing Library

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code passes all tests
2. Update documentation if necessary
3. Add a description of your changes to the pull request
4. Link any related issues
5. Be responsive to feedback and be willing to make changes if requested

## Feature Requests and Bug Reports

If you have ideas for new features or have found a bug:

1. Check if the feature or bug has already been reported in the issues
2. If not, open a new issue with a clear description
3. For bugs, include steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior
